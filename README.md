# Milestone_532_new

### The apps

Please find the app [here](https://tinaqian2017.shinyapps.io/dsci_532_milestone/).

### Functionality

If you are interested in the crime rate in the U.S.A, it is the app that helps you to discover that. In the "Map" page, you can visualize the geographical distribution of the crime rate by types and years. In the "Data Explore" page, you can assign weights to different crime types based on your personal concerns, to calculate your risk score for each state that has crime data recorded in the Marshall Violent Crime dataset.   

**Target of the app**

The app is made for people plan to visit the U.S.A so they can avoid dangerous places as their destination.
### Acknowledgement
**Data**
The Marshall Violent Crime dataset is used to build the app. More details about the dataset can be found [here](https://github.ubc.ca/ubc-mds-2017/DSCI_532_milestone1_qyue2014/tree/master/data/marshall). I used
the data in `maps` package in R to draw the map of the United States. Moreover, I use information provided in the
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_states_and_territories_of_the_United_States) to create the file "states_abbr.csv" in the data folder.
